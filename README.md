# AfterLove ❤️‍🩹

AfterLove is an **18+ Life & Love Reality Test** designed to reflect

related to love, attachment, vulnerability, emotional growth, and intimacy.

Lower score = more lived and emotionally intense experience.

## 🧭 Score Meaning

- **90–100** → Guarded / Untouched  
- **70–89** → Exploring & Learning  
- **40–69** → Scarred but Self-Aware  
- **0–39** → Deeply Lived, Deeply Changed
